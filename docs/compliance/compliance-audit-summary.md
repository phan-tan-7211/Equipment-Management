# Compliance Self-Audit Summary

**Issue:** #496 - Compliance Self-Audit & Remediation (SOC 2 / PCI Prep)  
**Date:** January 26, 2026  
**Status:** In Progress

## Overview

This document summarizes the compliance audit and remediation work performed for EquipQR to align with SOC 2 Type 1 and PCI DSS SAQ-A requirements.

## Phase 1: Security & Access Control

### ✅ Audit Row Level Security (RLS)

**Status:** Completed (Previously addressed in migration `20260113210000_fix_rls_cross_tenant_vulnerabilities.sql`)

**Findings:**
- RLS policies are properly implemented across all tenant-isolated tables
- Organization membership checks are enforced in user-ownership policies
- Cross-tenant access vulnerabilities have been addressed
- All business tables have RLS enabled with proper organization isolation

**Recommendation:** Continue periodic RLS audits as new tables are added.

### ✅ Secret Scanning

**Status:** Completed

**Findings:**
- No hardcoded secrets found in source code
- All API keys and secrets use environment variables
- `.env.example` file documents all required environment variables
- Test files contain only mock/test data (not real secrets)

**Action Taken:**
- Verified all secrets are properly externalized
- Confirmed `.env.example` is comprehensive and up-to-date

### ⚠️ Enforce MFA

**Status:** Pending Implementation

**Current State:**
- Supabase Auth supports MFA but it's not currently enforced for admin routes
- MFA can be enabled per-user via Supabase Dashboard
- No application-level MFA enforcement for admin accounts

**Recommendation:**
- Enable MFA requirement for users with admin/owner roles
- Implement MFA check in admin route guards
- Document MFA setup process for administrators

## Phase 2: Data Protection

### ✅ Encryption in Transit

**Status:** Completed (Previously addressed)

**Findings:**
- All database connections enforce SSL/TLS
- API calls use HTTPS
- Supabase enforces encrypted connections by default

### ✅ Disaster Recovery Plan

**Status:** Completed (Previously addressed)

**Findings:**
- Disaster Recovery Plan documentation exists
- Supabase provides point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Backup and restore procedures are documented

### ✅ Data Minimization

**Status:** Reviewed

**Findings:**
- `profiles` table contains:
  - `email` - Required for authentication and communication (necessary PII)
  - `name` - Required for user identification in the app (necessary PII)
  - `email_private` - Privacy flag allows users to hide email from org members (good practice)
- No unnecessary PII fields identified
- All stored PII is necessary for application functionality

**Recommendation:** Current PII usage is appropriate. No fields recommended for deprecation.

## Phase 3: Logging & Integrity

### ✅ Implement Audit Logs

**Status:** Completed

**Implementation:**
- Comprehensive audit log system exists (`audit_log` table)
- Tracks changes to equipment, work orders, inventory, PM, and permissions
- Added invoice export audit logging (migration `20260126000000_add_invoice_export_audit_logging.sql`)
- Audit logs record:
  - User ID (actor_id)
  - Action (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
  - Timestamp (created_at)
  - IP address (in metadata for invoice exports)
  - Changes made (JSONB)

**Action Taken:**
- Created `log_invoice_export_audit()` function to track invoice creation/updates
- Integrated audit logging into QuickBooks export function
- Audit logs are immutable (append-only)

### ✅ Change Management Policy

**Status:** Completed

**Implementation:**
- Added Change Management Policy section to `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- Policy requires:
  - All changes go through Pull Requests
  - At least one maintainer approval required
  - CI/CD checks must pass
  - Security review for auth/authorization changes
  - Documentation updates for user-facing changes

**Action Taken:**
- Documented PR approval requirements
- Defined emergency hotfix process
- Specified enforcement mechanisms

## Phase 4: Financial Compliance (QuickBooks/PCI)

### ✅ PCI Tokenization Check

**Status:** Compliant

**Findings:**
- EquipQR does not accept, store, or log raw credit card numbers
- Payment processing (if used) would go through Stripe, which handles tokenization
- QuickBooks integration exports invoices only - does not handle payment card data
- No payment card data flows through EquipQR systems

**Compliance Status:** PCI DSS SAQ-A compliant (no cardholder data handled)

### ✅ Production Access Policy

**Status:** Completed

**Implementation:**
- Created Access Control Policy document (`docs/ops/access-control-policy.md`)
- Policy states:
  - Only ZNT LLC owners have write access to production database
  - Read access restricted to owners and authorized support personnel
  - Service role key usage is documented and restricted
  - Access review and audit procedures defined

**Action Taken:**
- Documented production access controls
- Defined access request and approval process
- Specified incident response procedures
