# Supabase Database Branching

> Operational runbook for the per-PR ephemeral Supabase branching workflow that EquipQR enabled on 2026-05-03 as part of [issue #722](https://github.com/Columbia-Cloudworks-LLC/EquipQR/issues/722) (Sub-change 3 of 3).

## Cloud hostname vs ephemeral branches

| Surface | Database |
|---------|----------|
| **`preview.equipqr.app`** / **`equipqr.app`** | **Current live:** production Supabase (`https://supabase.equipqr.app`). **Approved target:** move `preview.equipqr.app` to a new persistent dataless branch per [preview-persistent-branch.md](./preview-persistent-branch.md). |
| **PR touching `supabase/**`** | **Ephemeral** Supabase branch for schema/RLS validation only; deleted when the PR closes. |
| **Cursor Cloud Agent sessions** | **Per-session** ephemeral branch + cloud-safe Quick Login seed (not Docker-local Supabase). See [cloud-agent-ephemeral-stack.md](./cloud-agent-ephemeral-stack.md). |

Do not assume the persistent preview branch cutover has already happened. Today,
ordinary (non-schema) QA on `preview.equipqr.app` still hits production data
APIs. The approved replacement is a new long-lived dataless branch documented in
[preview-persistent-branch.md](./preview-persistent-branch.md). Exercise risky
OAuth/integration paths on the **local stack** before merge until that cutover
lands.

## What it is

Supabase Database Branching creates a separate, isolated Supabase instance (its
own Postgres, its own API, its own auth, its own anon key) per PR. When a PR is
opened that touches database schema, Supabase clones the production schema into
a new branch, runs the PR's migrations against that branch, and exposes a
unique URL + anon key for the branch. When the PR closes (merged or not), the
branch is auto-deleted.

The point: schema migrations are validated against a real Postgres instance —
not just locally — before they land on git **`preview`** (and later promote to
`main`). This catches Postgres-version drift, RLS-policy interaction bugs, and
migration ordering issues that local `supabase db reset` cannot reproduce.

This doc covers **ephemeral PR branches only**. The separate decision to give
`preview.equipqr.app` its own persistent dataless backend is tracked in
[preview-persistent-branch.md](./preview-persistent-branch.md).

## Trigger policy

Branching is configured via the Supabase Dashboard's **`Supabase changes only`** toggle, which creates a preview branch when ANY file under the `supabase/` directory changes — NOT just `supabase/migrations/**`. That means a PR is branched when it touches any of:

- `supabase/migrations/**` (schema changes — the highest-risk surface)
- `supabase/functions/**` (Edge Function changes)
- `supabase/config.toml` (project config — auth, CORS, function settings)
- `supabase/seeds/**` (local-dev seeds)
- Any other file under `supabase/`

PRs that touch only application code (`src/**`), CI, docs, or other non-Supabase paths do NOT trigger a branch.

The policy lives in the Supabase Dashboard, not in `supabase/config.toml`:

```text
https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ymxkzronkhwxzcdcbnwq → Settings → Integrations → GitHub Integration
Automatic branching: ON
Supabase changes only: ON   ← triggers on any supabase/** change
Branch limit: 50            ← hard cap (auto-rejects new branches above this)
Deploy to production: ON    ← auto-deploys to main on push/merge
```

**Why broader than just `supabase/migrations/**`**: this is the only built-in trigger granularity Supabase exposes today (the alternative is "every PR", which is materially noisier). The over-trigger is bounded by the 50-branch hard cap and by branches auto-deleting on PR close.

## Cost model

Live pricing (<https://supabase.com/pricing>, validated 2026-05-03):

- **Per branch:** $0.01344 / hour.
- **Typical PR touching `supabase/` (24-hour life):** ~$0.32.
- **Typical week, broader trigger (10–15 PRs touching `supabase/` × 36h average):** ~$5–7 → **~$25–35/mo**.
  - This is the realistic estimate with the `Supabase changes only` trigger (broader than the original "migrations only" projection of ~$14/mo). Edge Function changes and `config.toml` tweaks now also trigger branches.
- **Worst case (50-branch cap × ~$10/branch over multi-day life):** ~$500/mo, bounded by the dashboard's branch limit.

## Branch lifecycle

1. **PR opened** with a commit that modifies any file under `supabase/`.
2. **Supabase GitHub App** (already connected per the existing integration) detects the change, clones the production schema (no data — branches are dataless by design), and starts the deployment workflow:
   - **Clone** → checks out the repo at the PR's HEAD.
   - **Pull** → retrieves prior production migrations to seed the migration history table.
   - **Health** → waits up to ~2 minutes for all Supabase services on the branch (Auth, API, Postgres, Storage, Realtime) to come up.
   - **Configure** → applies any branch-specific overrides from `supabase/config.toml`.
   - **Migrate** → runs the PR's pending migrations against the branch.
   - **Seed** → optional; only runs if a seed file is registered (we do not seed by default to avoid leaking production data shape).
   - **Deploy** → ships any changed Edge Functions to the branch.
3. **PR open** → branch URL + anon key visible at
   <https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ymxkzronkhwxzcdcbnwq/branches>.
4. **PR closed/merged** → Supabase auto-deletes the branch.

## How to access a branch

While a PR is open, the Branches page shows each active branch with:
- A unique project URL (e.g. `https://branch-abc123.supabase.co`)
- A unique anon key (rotated per-branch)
- Links to the branch's Studio, Logs, and Edge Functions

To exercise the branch from a Vite preview:
- Vercel automatically generates a preview URL per PR (via the existing GitHub integration).
- Today, the Vercel preview for git `preview` points at the production Supabase
  project by default (via build-time `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`). The approved target
  is to move that stable hostname to a persistent dataless branch per
  [preview-persistent-branch.md](./preview-persistent-branch.md).
- For ephemeral PR-branch validation, point a Vercel Preview deployment at the
  branch URL + anon key only when you need that specific schema/RLS check, or
  use the branch's anon key inline in browser DevTools for a one-off check.
- For most validation (does the migration apply? does RLS still pass?), the branch's Studio + the branch's SQL Editor are sufficient — no Vite preview needed.

## What branching does NOT do

- **Branches are dataless.** They have the production schema but no production rows. If your migration depends on existing data shapes (e.g. backfills based on row content), test that locally with seeded data before relying on the branch.
- **Branches do not test Edge Function CORS / auth / cron behavior automatically.** Edge Functions deploy to the branch but only run when invoked. Cron jobs in `supabase/migrations` will be scheduled on the branch and start firing — this is mostly fine but worth knowing if a cron job has external side effects.
- **Branches do not clone Vault secrets.** If your migration depends on a Vault entry (e.g. the Stripe FDW pilot's `stripe_fdw_api_key`), the branch's Vault is empty unless you add the secret manually via the branch's Studio.
- **Branches don't catch post-deploy / production data issues.** They catch migration syntax, RLS interactions, and Postgres version compatibility. Production-data-shape bugs surface only after merge to `preview`.
- **Branches are not the same thing as the planned persistent preview backend.**
  Keep ephemeral PR validation and the future `preview.equipqr.app` branch as
  separate operational paths.

## Cleanup if a branch is stuck

If the auto-delete on PR close fails (e.g. PR was force-closed during a deployment workflow run):

1. Open <https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ymxkzronkhwxzcdcbnwq/branches>.
2. Find the stuck branch.
3. Click the three-dot menu → **Delete branch**.
4. Confirm. The branch is destroyed within a minute.

## Disabling branching (rollback)

If branching causes unexpected behavior (e.g. CI workflows break because of branch-creation timing), the rollback is dashboard-only:

1. Open <https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/ymxkzronkhwxzcdcbnwq> →
   **Branches** → **Settings**.
2. Click **Disable branching**.
3. No code change needed — the comment block in `supabase/config.toml` and this doc are dormant without branching enabled.

## Cursor Cloud Agents (session branches)

PR branching above is **schema/RLS validation only** (dataless, no Quick Login). Cloud Agents that need Dev Quick Login against an isolated backend use a separate lifecycle:

- Create → seed (Auth Admin API) → point Vite at the branch → delete on teardown/TTL
- Documented in [cloud-agent-ephemeral-stack.md](./cloud-agent-ephemeral-stack.md) (`dev/cloud-agent-ephemeral-stack.sh`)
- Does **not** replace this PR GitHub Integration path and must never seed production
