# Google Cloud Admin Access — Agent IAM Posture

> Operational reference for the two service accounts that act as Cursor agent identities against Google Cloud organization `476784721717` (`columbiacloudworks.com`). Documents the role posture, invocation patterns, security trade-offs, and the reapply procedure for new orgs or new projects.

## Human Google sign-in (Admin Console / GCP Console UI)

When gcloud MCP impersonation is insufficient (OAuth client redirect URIs, Workspace user security, Admin Console policy), agents may sign in through the browser using Columbia Cloudworks Agents vault item `Google (Business)`:

```powershell
. .\dev\e2e\Load-GoogleBusinessEnv.ps1
```

See `docs/ops/agent-secrets-and-access.md` for vault UUID, item IDs, and `op://` rules.

## Two-SA model

The Cursor agents in this workspace operate as one of two service accounts, both children of the `CEVphantanprod` project, both org-wide as of 2026-04:

| Service account | Role | When the agent uses it |
|---|---|---|
| `CEVphantancursor-agent-viewer@CCEVphantanrod.iam.gserviceaccount.com` | **Default identity** — every read-only investigation, every gcloud query, every audit-log read | Always (the agent's "default identity") |
| `CEVphantancursor-agent-editor-pr@CCEVphantanrod.iam.gserviceaccount.com` | **Elevation identity** — only invoked when the user explicitly asks for a change | Via `--impersonate-service-account` from the viewer session, on demand |

The viewer SA holds `roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` *on the editor SA* (a resource-level grant on the editor SA itself, scoped to project `CEVphantanprod`). That single grant is the impersonation chain — the viewer SA can mint short-lived OAuth tokens for the editor SA when (and only when) the agent passes `--impersonate-service-account`.

## Org-tier role posture

### Viewer SA (read-only across the entire org)

Granted on organization `476784721717` (Tier 2 of the original setup):

- `roles/browser`
- `roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer`
- `roles/resourcemanager.folderViewer`
- `roles/iam.securityReviewer`
- `roles/logging.privateLogViewer`
- `roles/logging.viewAccessor`
- `roles/monitoring.viewer`
- `roles/billing.viewer`
- `roles/cloudasset.viewer`
- `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageViewer`
- `roles/orgpolicy.policyViewer`
- `roles/securitycenter.adminViewer`

Plus, on each of the four billing accounts under the org (`011523-563BCD-AEF141`, `013785-72B06A-A89CAC`, `01606A-9B223B-B345F7`, `01C54A-FE04FD-748113`):

- `roles/billing.viewer`

### Editor SA (co-admin write across the entire org)

Granted on organization `476784721717`:

- `roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin` *(the keystone — manages IAM on the org, folders, and projects)*
- `roles/resourcemanager.folderAdmin`
- `roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator`
- `roles/resourcemanager.projectMover`
- `roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin`
- `roles/iam.organizationRoleAdmin`
- `roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin`
- `roles/logging.admin`
- `roles/monitoring.admin`
- `roles/cloudasset.owner`
- `roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin`
- `roles/securitycenter.admin`
- `roles/billing.user`

Plus, on each of the four billing accounts:

- `roles/billing.admin`

### Deliberately NOT granted

- **`roles/owner`** — Google's [best practices for service accounts](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/best-practices-service-accounts) explicitly say "don't grant Owner to SAs in production". The bundle above is functionally equivalent for org-admin work and traceable to specific permissions in audit logs.
- **`roles/editor`** — same rationale.
- **Workspace super-admin** — lives on the Workspace tenant at admin.google.com, not on Cloud IAM. Stays with humans (Nicholas).

## Agent invocation patterns

### Default (read-only)

```powershell
# Agent's default behavior — runs as viewer SA.
gcloud projects list
gcloud logging read '...' --organization=476784721717
gcloud organizations get-iam-policy 476784721717
```

### Explicit elevation (write)

```powershell
# When the agent needs to make a change, it adds --impersonate-service-account
# to the specific command. Only that one command runs as the editor SA.
gcloud projects set-iam-policy <project> policy.yaml `
  --impersonate-service-account=CEVphantancursor-agent-editor-pr@CCEVphantanrod.iam.gserviceaccount.com

gcloud projects create my-new-project `
  --organization=476784721717 `
  --impersonate-service-account=CEVphantancursor-agent-editor-pr@CCEVphantanrod.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

The agent should **never** switch the active gcloud account to the editor SA via `gcloud config set account`. Always keep the viewer SA as the default and use `--impersonate-service-account` on a per-command basis.

### Audit trail

Every command run under the editor SA appears in org-tier Cloud Logging Admin Activity logs under:

```
protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail = "CEVphantancursor-agent-editor-pr@CCEVphantanrod.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
```

with the impersonating principal also captured under `protoPayload.authenticationInfo.serviceAccountDelegationInfo[].principalSubject`. This means every elevated action is fully traceable to (a) the editor SA that performed it, and (b) the viewer SA / human that requested the impersonation.

## Reapply / new-org bootstrap

The full role posture above can be reapplied to a new Google Cloud organization (or re-seeded after a teardown) by running the following from a shell signed in as a human with `roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin` on the target org. Replace the `$org` and SA emails for the new context.

### 1. Viewer SA org-wide read

```powershell
$org    = "<TARGET_ORG_ID>"
$viewer = "serviceAccount:<viewer-sa@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com>"

$viewerRoles = @(
  "roles/browser",
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationViewer",
  "roles/resourcemanager.folderViewer",
  "roles/iam.securityReviewer",
  "roles/logging.privateLogViewer",
  "roles/logging.viewAccessor",
  "roles/monitoring.viewer",
  "roles/billing.viewer",
  "roles/cloudasset.viewer",
  "roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageViewer",
  "roles/orgpolicy.policyViewer",
  "roles/securitycenter.adminViewer"
)

foreach ($role in $viewerRoles) {
  gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding $org --member=$viewer --role=$role --condition=None | Out-Null
}
```

### 2. Editor SA org-wide co-admin

```powershell
$org    = "<TARGET_ORG_ID>"
$editor = "serviceAccount:<editor-sa@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com>"

$editorRoles = @(
  "roles/resourcemanager.organizationAdmin",
  "roles/resourcemanager.folderAdmin",
  "roles/resourcemanager.projectCreator",
  "roles/resourcemanager.projectMover",
  "roles/orgpolicy.policyAdmin",
  "roles/iam.organizationRoleAdmin",
  "roles/iam.serviceAccountAdmin",
  "roles/logging.admin",
  "roles/monitoring.admin",
  "roles/cloudasset.owner",
  "roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageAdmin",
  "roles/securitycenter.admin",
  "roles/billing.user"
)

foreach ($role in $editorRoles) {
  gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding $org --member=$editor --role=$role --condition=None | Out-Null
}
```

### 3. Impersonation chain

```powershell
$editorEmail = "<editor-sa@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com>"
$viewer      = "serviceAccount:<viewer-sa@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com>"

gcloud iam service-accounts add-iam-policy-binding $editorEmail `
  --member=$viewer `
  --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator" `
  --project=<project>
```

### 4. Billing accounts

```powershell
$editor = "serviceAccount:<editor-sa@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com>"
$viewer = "serviceAccount:<viewer-sa@<project>.iam.gserviceaccount.com>"
$billingAccounts = @("<BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID_1>", "<BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID_2>")

foreach ($acct in $billingAccounts) {
  gcloud beta billing accounts add-iam-policy-binding $acct --member=$editor --role="roles/billing.admin" | Out-Null
  gcloud beta billing accounts add-iam-policy-binding $acct --member=$viewer --role="roles/billing.viewer" | Out-Null
}
```

## Future projects under the same org

Projects created under organization `476784721717` (whether by the editor SA via `gcloud projects create --organization=476784721717`, or manually in the Console) **inherit all of the role bindings above automatically**. There is no per-project re-grant needed — the viewer SA can read everything in the new project, and the editor SA can manage IAM on it, the moment it appears.

## Reversal

Every `add-iam-policy-binding` above has a matching `remove-iam-policy-binding` form. The setup is fully reversible by running the same scripts with `remove-iam-policy-binding` in place of `add-iam-policy-binding`. The impersonation grant from step 3 can be revoked with:

```powershell
gcloud iam service-accounts remove-iam-policy-binding $editorEmail `
  --member=$viewer `
  --role="roles/iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator" `
  --project=CEVphantanprod
```

## Security notes

- **Lateral movement is bounded.** The only impersonation chain in this setup is viewer → editor (one hop, intentional, auditable). No other SA can mint tokens for either of these two.
- **No SA keys.** This setup uses Application Default Credentials and impersonation throughout. The org policy `iam.disableServiceAccountKeyCreation` (already enforced on this org) stays compatible — nothing here attempts to mint long-lived keys.
- **Workspace super-admin remains separate.** The Workspace data-sharing toggle, OAuth log surfacing, and any tenant-level admin action stays with humans on admin.google.com. The editor SA cannot perform Workspace admin actions even with org-admin rights on Cloud, by design.
- **Auditability.** Every action by either SA is captured in org-tier Cloud Logging Admin Activity (`cloudaudit.googleapis.com%2Factivity` under `organizations/476784721717/logs/`). For elevated actions, the original requesting principal appears in `serviceAccountDelegationInfo`.
