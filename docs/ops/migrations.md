## Overview

EquipQR™ uses Supabase for database management with a structured migration system. This guide covers migration best practices, naming conventions, and troubleshooting.

## Migration File Structure

### Naming Convention

Migration files must follow this exact pattern:

```text
YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_descriptive_name.sql
```

**Examples:**

- ✅ `20250822120000_add_team_id_to_work_orders.sql`
- ✅ `20250822120100_create_equipment_notes_table.sql`
- ❌ `20250822120000-.sql` (invalid: missing name)
- ❌ `20250822-120000-add-feature.sql` (invalid: uses dashes)

### File Organization

```text
supabase/migrations/
├── 20250730000100_work_orders_baseline.sql    # Early baseline tables
├── 20250730000200_equipment_baseline.sql      # Core table definitions
├── 20250822120000_add_team_features.sql       # Feature additions
├── 20250822130000_update_rls_policies.sql     # Policy updates
└── 20250822140000_add_indexes.sql             # Performance optimizations
```

## Migration Best Practices

### 1. Never Rename Applied Migrations ⚠️

**CRITICAL RULE**: Once a migration has been applied to production, NEVER rename or change its timestamp.

- Production migration timestamps are permanent and immutable
- Renaming creates a mismatch between local and remote databases
- Supabase will report "Remote migration versions not found in local migrations directory"
- **Always check production migrations before renaming** using Supabase MCP tools:

  ```bash
  # Use mcp_supabase_list_migrations to see production state
  ```

**If you need to fix migration order:**

- ✅ For NEW migrations: Set correct timestamp before first deployment
- ✅ For historical issues: Create placeholder files matching production timestamps
- ❌ Never rename migrations already applied to production

### 2. Baseline-First Rule

Critical tables like `work_orders`, `equipment`, and `organizations` must have baseline `CREATE TABLE` migrations that run early in the sequence. This ensures `supabase db reset` works correctly.

### 3. Idempotent Operations

Always use safe operations that won't fail if run multiple times:

```sql
-- ✅ Safe operations
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.example_table (...);
ALTER TABLE public.example_table ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS new_column text;
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_example ON public.example_table(column_name);

-- ❌ Unsafe operations
CREATE TABLE public.example_table (...);  -- Fails if table exists
ALTER TABLE public.example_table ADD COLUMN new_column text;  -- Fails if column exists
```

### 4. Production is Source of Truth

**Always verify production state before making migration changes:**

```bash
# Check what migrations are applied in production
# Use Supabase MCP tools: mcp_supabase_list_migrations

# Compare with local migrations
ls supabase/migrations/*.sql

# Create placeholder files for any missing migrations
# Match production timestamps exactly
```

**If local and remote are out of sync:**

1. Use MCP tools to list production migrations
2. Create placeholder files for any missing locally
3. Revert any incorrectly renamed migrations to match production
4. Never assume local is correct - production is the source of truth

### 5. Row Level Security (RLS)

Always enable RLS on new tables and create appropriate policies:

```sql
-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.new_table ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own data" 
ON public.new_table 
FOR SELECT 
USING (user_id = auth.uid());
```

### 6. Constraints and Validation

Use validation triggers instead of CHECK constraints for time-based validations:

```sql
-- ❌ Avoid CHECK constraints with time functions
ALTER TABLE public.invitations 
ADD CONSTRAINT expires_future CHECK (expires_at > now());

-- ✅ Use validation triggers instead
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION validate_expiration()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.expires_at <= now() THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'Expiration date must be in the future';
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER validate_invitation_expiration
  BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON public.invitations
  FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION validate_expiration();
```

## Local Development

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT: Local-First Development Workflow**
>
> **All database development should be done locally first, then deployed to production.**
>
> This is the standard workflow:
>
> 1. **Develop locally** - Create and test migrations on your local Supabase instance
> 2. **Test locally** - Verify migrations work with `npx supabase db reset`
> 3. **Deploy to production** - Only after local testing is successful

**Note**: Supabase CLI is included as a dev dependency in this project. Always use `npx supabase` commands. Do NOT install globally with `npm install -g supabase` as global installation is not supported.

### Local Development Workflow

**Standard workflow for creating new migrations:**

1. **Create the migration file**:

   ```bash
   npx supabase migration new your_migration_name
   ```

2. **Write your migration SQL** in the generated file

3. **Test locally** (REQUIRED before production deployment):

   ```bash
   # Reset local database and apply all migrations (including your new one)
   npx supabase db reset
   
   # Verify schema matches expectations
   npx supabase db diff
   ```

4. **Generate types** after successful local testing:

   ```bash
   npx supabase gen types typescript --local > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
   ```

5. **Regenerate the schema reference dump** (REQUIRED for any DDL/schema-changing migration — see [Schema Reference File](#schema-reference-file-current_schemasql)):

   ```bash
   npx supabase db dump --local -f supabase/current_schema.sql
   ```

6. **Verify the reference dump is fresh** (same check CI runs):

   ```bash
   npm run verify:schema-reference
   ```

7. **Commit the migration together with** `supabase/current_schema.sql` (and regenerated types).

8. **Deploy to production** only after local testing succeeds:

   ```bash
   npx supabase db push --linked
   ```

### Running Migrations Locally

```bash
# Apply all pending migrations to local database
npx supabase db push

# Reset database to clean state and apply all migrations (primary testing method)
npx supabase db reset

# Generate types after migrations
npx supabase gen types typescript --local > src/integrations/supabase/types.ts
```

### Testing Migrations

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Always test migrations locally before deploying to production.**

Before pushing to production, you MUST test the complete migration chain locally:

```bash
# Test complete database reset (this is the primary testing method)
npx supabase db reset

# Verify all tables and policies exist
npx supabase db diff

# Validate migration filenames
node dev/supabase-fix-migrations.mjs
```

**Why local testing is required:**

- Catches errors before they reach production
- Verifies migration order and dependencies
- Ensures idempotent operations work correctly
- Tests RLS policies and constraints

### Migration Validation Script

Use the project's migration fix script to validate filenames:

```bash
# Check and fix migration filenames
node dev/supabase-fix-migrations.mjs
```

## Schema Reference File (`current_schema.sql`)

### Purpose

`supabase/current_schema.sql` is a **derived reference dump**: one readable file containing the full schema produced by applying every migration in `supabase/migrations/`. It exists for:

- Quick schema comprehension without replaying dozens of incremental migration files
- AI-assisted development (Cursor prompts, spec-driven work) — agents read one file instead of the whole migration chain
- Architecture reviews and onboarding

It is **not** applied to any database and is **not** a migration. It complements `supabase/schema.sql` (auto-exported from production by `export-schema.yml`); `current_schema.sql` is the *developer-maintained* dump of what the local migration chain produces.

### The rule

> **Regenerate `supabase/current_schema.sql` after any DDL/schema-changing migration, and commit it in the same change as the migration.**

DDL/schema-changing means anything that alters structure: `CREATE`/`ALTER`/`DROP` on tables, columns, indexes, functions, triggers, policies, grants, views, or extensions.

### Regeneration commands

With the local stack running and all migrations applied (`.\dev\dev-start.bat -Force` or `npx supabase db reset`):

```bash
# Regenerate the reference dump from the local database
npx supabase db dump --local -f supabase/current_schema.sql

# Verify freshness (same check CI runs)
npm run verify:schema-reference
```

### When regeneration can be skipped

Pure **data migrations** (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE backfills, seed corrections, queue maintenance) do not change the schema and do not require a regenerated dump. Opt out explicitly by adding this marker as its own comment line anywhere in the migration file:

```sql
-- schema-reference: skip
```

The CI guardrail treats migrations carrying that marker as data-only. If a migration mixes data and DDL, do **not** use the marker — regenerate the dump.

### AI-generated migrations

AI tools (Cursor agents, Copilot, spec-driven workflows) may draft migrations, but a **human remains responsible** for:

1. Reviewing the generated SQL (naming, idempotency, RLS, grants)
2. Testing locally with `npx supabase db reset`
3. Regenerating `supabase/current_schema.sql`
4. Committing the migration and the regenerated dump together

Agents working in this repo must treat dump regeneration as part of the migration task itself — never leave it for a follow-up commit.

### CI guardrail

`dev/check-schema-reference.mjs` runs in the **Supabase Migration Validator** workflow on every PR that touches `supabase/**`:

- PRs with **no** migration changes pass trivially (no false positives)
- PRs that change schema-affecting migrations **must** also change `supabase/current_schema.sql`, otherwise the check fails with the regeneration commands
- Migrations marked `-- schema-reference: skip` are exempt
- The check is git-based (diff + commit history) and requires **no database** in CI

Run it locally at any time with `npm run verify:schema-reference` (uses git history when no PR base is set; set `SCHEMA_REFERENCE_BASE_SHA=<base-sha>` to simulate the PR gate).

## Common Migration Patterns

### Adding New Table

```sql
-- Create table with proper defaults
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.new_feature (
  id uuid NOT NULL DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  organization_id uuid NOT NULL,
  name text NOT NULL,
  created_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at timestamp with time zone NOT NULL DEFAULT now()
);

-- Enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.new_feature ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies
CREATE POLICY "Organization members can view features" 
ON public.new_feature 
FOR SELECT 
USING (organization_id IN (
  SELECT organization_id FROM organization_members 
  WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND status = 'active'
));

-- Create indexes
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_new_feature_org_id ON public.new_feature(organization_id);

-- Create updated_at trigger
CREATE TRIGGER update_new_feature_updated_at
  BEFORE UPDATE ON public.new_feature
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION public.update_updated_at_column();
```

### Adding Column to Existing Table

```sql
-- Add column safely
ALTER TABLE public.existing_table 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS new_column text DEFAULT 'default_value';

-- Add index if needed
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_existing_table_new_column 
ON public.existing_table(new_column);

-- Update RLS policies if needed
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "old_policy_name" ON public.existing_table;
CREATE POLICY "updated_policy_name"
ON public.existing_table
FOR SELECT
USING (organization_id IN (
  SELECT organization_id FROM organization_members 
  WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND status = 'active'
));
```

### Creating Database Functions

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.calculate_something(param_id uuid)
RETURNS jsonb
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
SET search_path TO 'public'
AS $$
DECLARE
  result jsonb;
BEGIN
  -- Function logic here
  SELECT jsonb_build_object('success', true) INTO result;
  RETURN result;
EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
  RETURN jsonb_build_object('success', false, 'error', SQLERRM);
END;
$$;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Remote Migration Versions Not Found

**Problem:** "Remote migration versions not found in local migrations directory"
**Cause:** Local migration files renamed/missing while production has different versions.
**Solution:**

- Use Supabase MCP tools to list production migrations
- Create placeholder files matching production timestamps exactly
- Revert any renamed migrations to match production
- Never rename migrations after they've been applied to production

#### 2. Migration Fails on `db reset`

**Problem:** `ALTER TABLE` statements fail because base table doesn't exist.
**Solution:** Ensure baseline `CREATE TABLE` migrations exist early in the sequence.

#### 3. Invalid Migration Filenames

**Problem:** Files named `-.sql` or with dashes get skipped.
**Solution:** Run `node dev/supabase-fix-migrations.mjs` to normalize names.

#### 4. Constraint Violations

**Problem:** CHECK constraints with `now()` cause restoration failures.
**Solution:** Replace with validation triggers.

#### 5. RLS Policy Conflicts

**Problem:** Duplicate or conflicting policies prevent table access.
**Solution:** Use `DROP POLICY IF EXISTS` before creating new policies.

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check local migration status
npx supabase migration list

# Check production migrations (use Supabase MCP tools)
# mcp_supabase_list_migrations with project_id

# Compare local vs remote
ls supabase/migrations/*.sql | sort

# View specific migration
cat supabase/migrations/20250822120000_migration_name.sql

# Check database schema
npx supabase db diff

# Inspect table structure
npx supabase db shell
\d+ table_name

# Validate migration filenames
node dev/supabase-fix-migrations.mjs
```

### Emergency Recovery

If migrations are severely broken:

1. Backup any important data
2. Run `npx supabase db reset` to start fresh
3. Fix migration files using the naming conventions
4. Re-run `npx supabase db push`
5. Restore data if needed

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

The project includes automated migration validation in CI. Migrations are tested in the `test` job but not automatically applied to production.

### Production Deployment

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Local testing is required before production deployment.**

The standard deployment workflow is:

1. **Develop and test locally** (REQUIRED):

   ```bash
   # Create migration
   npx supabase migration new your_migration_name
   
   # Test locally
   npx supabase db reset
   npx supabase db diff
   ```

2. **Deploy to production** (only after local testing succeeds):

   ```bash
   # Deploy to production
   npx supabase db push --linked
   ```

3. **Verify deployment**:
   - Check production database schema
   - Test functionality in production
   - Monitor for any issues

**Note**: While staging environments can be used for additional validation, local testing with `npx supabase db reset` is the primary and required testing method before production deployment.

## Security Considerations

### RLS Policies

- Always enable RLS on tables containing user data
- Test policies thoroughly with different user scenarios
- Use security definer functions for complex access patterns

### Data Migration

- Never include sensitive data in migration files
- Use environment variables for configuration values
- Audit all migration files before deployment

This guide ensures reliable database migrations and helps prevent the common issues that cause CI failures.
