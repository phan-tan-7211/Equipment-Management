EquipQR QR codes are plain URLs — no extra app required. Your phone's camera opens the record directly in the browser or the EquipQR app if it is installed.

## 1. Open your camera app

Hold the phone about a hand's width from the QR code. iOS and Android automatically recognize QR codes — no third-party scanner needed.


## 2. Tap the notification banner

The camera shows a link like `https://equipqr.app/qr/equipment/<id>`. Tap it to open the equipment record.

## 3. Sign in if prompted

If you are not already logged in, EquipQR asks you to sign in first. After authentication the app returns you to the equipment you scanned.

::: tip Note
If you belong to more than one organization, EquipQR automatically switches you to the organization that owns the scanned equipment.

## 4. Verify the equipment header

Check the equipment name, make/model, and serial number match the machine you are standing in front of before acting.
