## Troubleshooting

### Images Not Appearing in Gallery

If images uploaded through work orders don't appear in the equipment Images tab:

1. Check that the work order is properly saved
2. Verify the image upload completed successfully
3. Refresh the page to see updated images
4. Contact your administrator if the issue persists

### Upload Issues

If you're having trouble uploading images:

1. Check your internet connection

3. Try reducing image file size if uploads are slow
4. Contact support if problems continue

## Best Practices

1. **Always add descriptive notes** with your images
2. **Use clear, well-lit photos** that show the issue clearly
3. **Include multiple angles** for complex problems
4. **Set the best image as the display photo** for easy identification
5. **Use private notes** for sensitive information
6. **Save your work frequently** to avoid losing progress
