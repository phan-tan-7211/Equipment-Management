# Migration Squashing Guide

This document describes the migration squashing approach and its limitations.

## Why Squash Migrations?

Over time, development produces many small "fix" migrations that slow down:
- Local development setup (`supabase db reset`)
- CI pipelines
- New team member onboarding

A baseline migration can help new environments apply a single SQL file instead of hundreds of incremental migrations.

## Current State

- **Baseline**: `supabase/migrations/20260114000000_baseline.sql` (13,000+ lines)
- **All Historical Migrations**: Kept in `supabase/migrations/` alongside the baseline
- **Active**: All migrations remain in the migrations folder
- **Reference schema export**: `supabase/schema.sql` (preview-sourced, read-only; not applied by CLI)
- **Reference RLS export**: `supabase/rls-policies.sql` (table posture + policy inventory; read-only)

Regenerate the reference exports locally:

```powershell
.\dev\export-schema-baseline.ps1
```

CI regenerates both files on `main` pushes via `.github/workflows/export-schema.yml` when `PREVIEW_DATABASE_URL` is configured.

## Important: Why We Don't Archive Migrations

**Do NOT move migrations to an archive folder.** Supabase CLI compares local migrations against the `supabase_migrations` table in remote databases. If historical migrations exist in the remote but not locally, you'll get:

```
Remote migration versions not found in local migrations directory.
```

The baseline migration is useful for:
- **Fresh local resets**: `supabase db reset` applies migrations in order; the baseline provides the starting schema
- **New environments**: A completely new database can use just the baseline

But for **existing production/staging databases**, all historical migrations must remain in the migrations folder.

## Validation Checklist

After any schema changes, verify with:

### 1. Fresh Local Reset

```bash
# Stop any running Supabase instance
npx supabase stop

# Reset and apply all migrations + seeds
npx supabase db reset

# Start services
npx supabase start
```

### 2. Schema Verification

```bash
# Verify all tables exist
npx supabase db dump --schema public --data-only | head -50

# Or connect to local DB and run:
# SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
```

### 3. RLS Policy Check

Verify RLS is enabled and policies exist:

```sql
SELECT tablename, policyname, cmd
FROM pg_policies
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
```

### 4. Core RPCs Exist

Verify critical functions are present:

```sql
SELECT routine_name
FROM information_schema.routines
WHERE routine_schema = 'public'
  AND routine_type = 'FUNCTION'
  AND routine_name IN (
    'sync_stripe_subscription_slots',
    'can_user_manage_quickbooks',
    'accept_invitation_atomic',
    'is_org_member'
  );
```

### 5. Seed Data Applied

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM organizations;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pm_templates;
```

### 6. App Smoke Test

1. Start the app: `npm run dev`
2. Log in with a seed user
3. Navigate to equipment list, work orders, and teams
4. Verify data loads and RLS allows appropriate access

## How to Regenerate the Baseline

When ready to create a new baseline (e.g., quarterly):

```bash
# 1. Link to production project
npx supabase link --project-ref <your-project-ref>

# 2. Dump current schema
npx supabase db dump --schema public --file supabase/migrations/<timestamp>_baseline.sql

# 3. Keep ALL migrations in the migrations folder
# Do NOT archive or delete old migrations!

# 4. Validate
npx supabase db reset
```

## Production/Staging Considerations

**Critical**: The baseline is supplementary, not a replacement for historical migrations.

- **Production/Staging**: Their schema is already current via incremental migrations. They ignore the baseline because those version numbers are already recorded.
- **Fresh Databases**: Will apply the baseline first, then any migrations with timestamps after the baseline.
- **Existing Dev DBs**: Keep working normally; migrations are applied incrementally.

## Files Reference

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `supabase/migrations/` | All migrations (baseline + historical + new) |
| `supabase/seeds/*.sql` | Seed data for local development |

## Baseline Exclusion Rules

When regenerating a baseline from `supabase db dump`, the dump captures ALL objects
currently in the schema, including tables that were explicitly dropped by later
migrations. Because the baseline timestamp is earlier than the drop migrations,
`supabase db reset` applies the baseline first (recreating the tables) and then
the drop migration (removing them again). This is harmless for local resets but
creates Supabase advisor noise on production if the advisor runs between the
baseline application and the drop.

**After generating a new baseline, manually remove:**

- Tables marked as `DEPRECATED` in their `COMMENT ON TABLE` (e.g., billing tables).
- Tables that have an explicit `DROP TABLE` migration later in the sequence.
- Associated indexes, constraints, triggers, policies, and grants for those tables.

**Tables removed in April 2026 remediation (must NOT reappear in future baselines):**

| Dropped table | Reason |
|---|---|
| `billing_events`, `billing_usage`, `billing_exemptions` | Billing deprecated Jan 2025 |
| `organization_subscriptions`, `organization_slots` | Billing deprecated Jan 2025 |
| `slot_purchases`, `user_license_subscriptions` | Billing deprecated Jan 2025 |
| `subscribers`, `stripe_event_logs` | Billing deprecated Jan 2025 |
| `distributor`, `distributor_listing` | Global part picker removed Dec 2025 |
| `part`, `part_identifier` | Global part picker removed Dec 2025 |
