## Reporting Issues

We use **GitHub Issues** for bugs, feature requests, and general questions.

### Before you report

1. **Search existing issues** to avoid duplicates.
2. **Use the latest version** (check the app footer or `package.json`).
3. **Skim the docs** above — your answer may already be there.

### How to report

- **Bugs**: [Open an issue](https://github.com/Columbia-Cloudworks-LLC/EquipQR/issues/new) with a clear summary, steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and your environment (browser/OS, EquipQR version, role).
- **Feature requests**: Same link; describe the use case, proposed solution, and who it helps.
- **Questions**: Open an issue and add the `question` label, or use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Columbia-Cloudworks-LLC/EquipQR/discussions) if you prefer.

Detailed templates and labels (e.g. `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`) are in [CONTRIBUTING.md – Reporting Issues](CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-issues).
