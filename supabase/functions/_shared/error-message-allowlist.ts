/**
 * Error Message Allowlist Configuration
 *
 * This file contains the allowlist of safe error message patterns that can be
 * exposed to clients. Only messages matching these patterns are considered safe
 * for client exposure, preventing information disclosure (CWE-209).
 *
 * MAINTENANCE NOTE: When adding new user-facing error messages to Edge Functions:
 * 1. Add a matching pattern to SAFE_ERROR_PATTERNS
 * 2. Add the corresponding canonical mapping in supabase-clients.ts
 * 3. Ensure the pattern is specific enough to not accidentally match debug info
 * 4. Prefer explicit full-message patterns over broad prefixes when possible
 * 5. Test by calling createErrorResponse with your new message and verifying
 *    it's not replaced with the generic error
 *
 * To validate error messages during development, check the console for
 * "[createErrorResponse] Unsafe error message blocked:" warnings.
 *
 * SECURITY MAINTENANCE: If you modify SAFE_ERROR_PATTERNS, also update the
 * canonical mapping and the MAINTENANCE NOTE in createErrorResponse's docstring
 * so documentation stays in sync with this implementation.
