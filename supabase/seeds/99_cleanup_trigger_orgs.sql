-- =====================================================
-- EquipQR Seed Data - Cleanup Trigger-Created Organizations
-- =====================================================
-- This file runs LAST (99_) and removes any organizations created by the
-- handle_new_user trigger during seeding.
--
-- The trigger fires when auth.users are inserted, creating an organization
-- for each user. But we want users to use our seeded organizations with
-- specific UUIDs, not the trigger-created ones.
--
-- This cleanup:
-- 1. Identifies orgs created by the trigger (not in our seed list)
-- 2. Deletes the organization_members for those orgs
-- 3. Deletes the organizations themselves
-- =====================================================

-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
-- Define the list of INTENDED organization IDs from our seeds
-- ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
-- These are the organizations we intentionally seeded (03_organizations.sql + 30_e2e_onboarding_fixture.sql)
-- Any organization NOT in this list was created by the trigger and should be removed.
