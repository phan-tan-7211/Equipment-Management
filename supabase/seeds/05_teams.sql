-- EquipQR Seed Data - Teams
-- =====================================================
-- 6 Teams across all organizations.
--
-- Production-faithful team-location pattern (prod has 19 teams, of which only
-- 3 have any location data and 0 have a populated street address):
--
--   * location_address is NEVER populated (0/19 in prod).
--   * Only ~15% of teams have lat/lng coordinates in prod; here we seed 2 of 6
--     so we exercise both the override-true and override-false paths through
--     the Fleet Map team-HQ rendering layer.
--   * Where coords exist, country is the literal string 'United States'.
--   * override_equipment_location = true is rare; we keep ONE explicit fixture
--     (Heavy Equipment Team) paired with equipment aa0e8400-...-446655440000
--     (CAT 320 Excavator) so the team-override map hierarchy is testable in
--     isolation. The second team with coords (Rental Fleet Team) keeps
--     override = false to mirror the prod pattern of "team has known HQ but
--     does not override its equipment locations".
