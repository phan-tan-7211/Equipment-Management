-- =============================================================================
-- Fix auto_provision_workspace_organization to reuse ANY non-personal org
-- 
-- Previously, the function only reused orgs with "Organization" in the name,
-- which was too restrictive. If a user manually created an org with a custom
-- name (e.g., "Columbia Cloud Works" instead of "Columbiacloudworks Organization"),
-- connecting Google Workspace would create a NEW org instead of using their existing one.
--
-- This fix removes the name restriction so the function reuses ANY non-personal
-- org the user owns, regardless of its name.
--
-- REVERT: Re-add `AND o.name LIKE '%Organization%'` to the org selection query below
