-- Forward-fix for 20260518120000 which created claim_quickbooks_invoice_status_events
-- with SET search_path = public, pg_temp instead of the project hardening convention
-- SET search_path = ''. All referenced objects are already schema-qualified so an
-- empty search_path is safe and eliminates the function_search_path_mutable advisory.
--
-- Idempotent: the DO block skips both the ALTER and the COMMENT when the function does
-- not exist (or its signature differs), so this migration is safe on any environment
-- regardless of migration subset applied.
