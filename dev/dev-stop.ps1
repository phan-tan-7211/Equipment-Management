# The port sweep above can only see Windows-side processes. The Windows
# kernel itself can also reserve port chunks within the ephemeral range
# (49152-65535) via WinNAT or Hyper-V, and Supabase's ports 54321-54328
# fall inside that range. When the dynamic allocator traps one of those
# ports, no `Get-NetTCPConnection` and no `docker ps` will reveal it --
# only `netsh int ipv4 show excludedportrange` does, and that range has
# no owning user-space process to kill.
#
# Crucially, this is NOT a Docker leak. Restarting Docker Desktop, killing
# the docker-desktop WSL distro, and pruning networks all leave it intact
# because the reservation belongs to the Windows TCP/IP stack itself. The
# only fix is a one-time Admin `netsh add excludedportrange ... store=
# persistent` registered for the Supabase port band, after which the
# kernel will skip those ports forever (across reboots). That fix lives
# in dev\reserve-supabase-ports.ps1 -- so dev-stop only diagnoses and
# tells the user how to fix it.
