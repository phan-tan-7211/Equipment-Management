            <p>
              EquipQR uses minimal browser storage, exclusively for application functionality. We do
              not use any third-party tracking cookies, advertising pixels, or browser
              fingerprinting techniques.
            </p>

            <p>
              On your first visit, EquipQR shows a cookies and browser-storage notice with explicit
              Accept and Reject choices. Your choice is stored in localStorage under{' '}
              <code>equipqr:cookie-consent</code> so the notice does not reappear on every page load
              (until you clear site data). Preference cookies and optional UI preferences are written
              only after Accept. Strictly necessary mechanisms (sign-in tokens, QR login redirects,
              offline queues, and the consent preference itself) remain available after Reject so you
              can still use core product flows. Security widgets such as hCaptcha and map surfaces
              may still load when those features are used; they are not advertising trackers.
            </p>

            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>
              We set one functional preference cookie when you Accept:
            </p>
            <PolicyList
              items={[
                {
                  label: <code>sidebar:state</code>,
                  content: (
                    <>
                      &mdash; Remembers whether the navigation sidebar is expanded or collapsed. Expires after 7
                      days. This cookie contains no personal information and is not shared with any third party.
                      It is not written when you Reject cookies.
                    </>
                  ),
                },
              ]}
            />

            <h3>Local Storage</h3>
            <p>
              We use your browser&apos;s localStorage for application state only:

            <PolicyList
              items={[
                {

                      carries the org hint from public QR scans into the dashboard. Strictly necessary for
                      correct organization scoping.
                    </>

                  ),

                      &mdash; Short-lived backups of in-progress PM checklists and template editors so a refresh
                      does not lose work. Strictly necessary for data integrity while editing.

            />
            <p>
              None of this data is sent to any server or third party. It remains in your browser
              and can be cleared at any time through your browser settings. Choosing Reject clears
              optional UI preference keys EquipQR controls and stops writing them until you Accept;
              strictly necessary keys listed above remain available.
            </p>

            <h3>Session Storage</h3>
            <p>
              We use sessionStorage for one purpose: storing a pending redirect URL when a QR code
              scan requires you to log in first. This value is cleared automatically after use or
              when the browser tab is closed. It is strictly necessary for that sign-in flow.
            </p>

            <h3>Authentication Session</h3>
            <p>
              Supabase Auth stores a JWT access token and refresh token in your browser. These
              tokens are used solely to authenticate your requests to EquipQR and are managed
              entirely by the Supabase Auth SDK. They are not accessible to third-party scripts.
              Authentication storage remains available regardless of Accept or Reject.
            </p></LegalPolicySection>
