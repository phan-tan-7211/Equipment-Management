        <LegalPolicySection title="Who We Are & How These Terms Work.">
            <p>
              These Terms of Service ("<strong>Terms</strong>") are a contract between <strong>Phan Tan</strong> ("<strong>Company</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>", or "<strong>our</strong>"),
              and the person or entity that creates an account or otherwise uses <strong>CEV™</strong> (the "<strong>Service</strong>")
              ("<strong>Customer</strong>", "<strong>you</strong>", or "<strong>your</strong>"). If you are using the Service on behalf of an entity,
              you represent that you have authority to bind that entity, and "you" refers to that entity. By accessing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
            </p></LegalPolicySection>

        <LegalPolicySection title="1) The Service.">
            <p>
              The Service is a fleet equipment management platform enabling equipment records, QR codes, maintenance scheduling, work orders, reporting, and user management. We may modify features from time to time. The Service is not an OEM specification, repair manual, or professional advice, and is not designed for high-risk or safety-critical use.
            </p></LegalPolicySection>

        <LegalPolicySection title="2) Accounts & Organization Admins.">
            <p>
              You must provide accurate registration details and keep them current. You are responsible for all activities under your account and for maintaining the confidentiality of credentials. Organization administrators control user access and may view, restrict, or remove users.
            </p></LegalPolicySection>

        <LegalPolicySection title="3) Acceptable Use.">
            <p>You will not (and will not allow anyone to):</p>

              <strong>Our IP Indemnity.</strong> We will defend you against third-party claims alleging that the Service infringes a U.S. patent, copyright, or trademark, and pay damages and costs finally awarded, provided you promptly notify us and cooperate.
