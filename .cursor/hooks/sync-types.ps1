# Cursor hook: regenerate Supabase TypeScript types after a migration edit.
#
# Reads JSON from stdin (same pattern as guard-migrations.ps1 / run-tests.ps1).
# When the edited file is a Supabase migration, runs `supabase gen types` and
# writes the result to src/integrations/supabase/types.ts.
#
# Why the validation/extraction logic exists:
# The Supabase CLI (~v2.77) writes ancillary messages to stdout (not stderr),
# including connection logs ("Connecting to db 5432") and CLI update banners
# ("A new version of Supabase CLI is available..."). A naive `> types.ts`
# redirect captures those lines into the generated file, producing TypeScript
# that does not compile. This script captures stdout+stderr together, then
# extracts only the content between the first `export type` declaration and
# the last `} as const`. Anything outside that range is treated as noise.
# If either anchor is missing, the existing types.ts is left untouched and
# the captured output is echoed so the developer can see what the CLI did.
#
# This hook is intentionally non-blocking: every exit path is `exit 0`, and
# any unexpected terminating error is caught and logged so it cannot abort
# Cursor's edit pipeline.

# Defensive stdin parsing - match the pattern used in guard-migrations.ps1
# so the hook tolerates payload changes or non-JSON input.
