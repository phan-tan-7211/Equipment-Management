## Project overview

EquipQR is a QR-first work order app for heavy equipment repair shops, built with React, TypeScript, and Supabase.

**Key Technologies:**
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Edge Functions)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
- State: TanStack Query
- Testing: Vitest, React Testing Library

## Branching Model

EquipQR uses a **feat → preview → main** train (#1282). Authoritative policy: [`docs/ops/git-and-deploy.md`](docs/ops/git-and-deploy.md).

### Branch Environments

| Branch | Purpose | Deployment | Public URL |
|--------|---------|------------|------------|
| `main` | Production source of truth | Vercel Production (promote gate) | equipqr.app |
| **`preview`** | Integration / pre-production train | Vercel **Preview** | preview.equipqr.app |
| **`feat/*`** | One feature at a time | Vercel **Preview** per PR | Commit-specific `*.vercel.app` URL |

> Current live preview still uses production Supabase. The approved target is a
> new persistent dataless preview branch documented in
> [`docs/ops/preview-persistent-branch.md`](./docs/ops/preview-persistent-branch.md).
> Ephemeral Supabase PR branches still validate `supabase/**` changes only.

### Branch Flow

1. **Feature branches** (off `preview`)
   - `git fetch origin preview` then `git switch -c feat/<short-name> origin/preview`
   - Open PR with `--base preview`
   - CI + Supabase PR branch (when migrations change) must pass before merge
   - Accumulate CHANGELOG `[Unreleased]`; **do not** bump `package.json`

2. **Preview QA**
   - Vercel assigns a commit-specific URL per push/PR — use that for day-to-day validation
   - After merge to git **`preview`**, **`preview.equipqr.app`** updates via normal Vercel deploys

3. **Production** (`main`)
   - Promote via **`preview` → `main`** (or `/release`) with version bump + empty Unreleased
   - **Production Release Readiness** runs `vercel promote`

4. **Hotfixes**
   - Prefer `fix/*` → `preview` then promote; emergencies may PR into `main` then back-merge `preview`

**Note**: Version tags are created automatically when `package.json` is updated on `main`. See [Versioning & Release Process](#versioning--release-process) below.

## Versioning & Release Process

EquipQR uses **semantic versioning**. GitHub Actions creates tags when a bumped `package.json` lands on `main`. Record concise customer-facing changes under `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]`.

### How It Works

1. **Feature PRs into `preview`**:
   - Accumulate short `[Unreleased]` bullets
   - Do **not** bump `package.json`

2. **`/release` promote (`preview` → `main`)**:
   - Choose one SemVer for the whole batch
   - Empty `[Unreleased]` into one `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` section
   - Bump `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and the README version badge

3. **`version-tag.yml`**:
   - Runs when that bumped `package.json` lands on `main`
   - Validates semver format (x.y.z)
   - Creates annotated git tag `vX.Y.Z` if it does not already exist
   - Pushes the tag to origin

### Semantic Versioning Guidelines

- **Major** (X.0.0): Only when the user requests a breaking customer-visible change
- **Minor** (X.Y.0): New customer-visible capability or meaningful workflow expansion
- **Patch** (X.Y.Z): Fixes, security without product-shape change, batched dependencies, small UX corrections
- Do not cut a patch for a single Dependabot bump

### Version Display

The application displays the current version in the footer:
- Local development: `vdev`
- Deployed environments: Shows the version from the latest git tag (e.g., `v1.2.3`)

### Rollback

If a version is created incorrectly:

```bash
# Delete tag locally and remotely
git tag -d vX.Y.Z
git push origin --delete vX.Y.Z

# Delete GitHub Release via GitHub UI (Releases → Delete)

# Revert package.json commit if needed
git revert <commit-sha>
git push origin <branch>
```

### Reference Documentation

For technical details on CI/CD workflows including version tagging, see [`docs/ops/ci-cd-pipeline.md`](./docs/ops/ci-cd-pipeline.md).

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Columbia-Cloudworks-LLC/EquipQR.git
   cd EquipQR
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in required values (see [README.md](./README.md))

4. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Making Changes

1. Branch off `origin/preview`: `git switch -c feat/<short-name> origin/preview`
2. Follow the coding guidelines below
3. Write tests for new features
4. Run linting and tests before pushing:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm run type-check
   npm run test
   ```

### Pushing Your Work

```bash
# Push your feature branch
git push -u origin feat/<short-name>

# Open a PR targeting preview
gh pr create --base preview --head feat/<short-name> --title "Your feature description"
```

## CI/CD Policy

### Pull requests to `preview`

**On Pull Requests** (e.g., `feat/*` → `preview`):
- ✅ Linting (ESLint)
- ✅ Type checking (TypeScript)
- ✅ Unit tests with coverage
- ✅ Build validation
- ✅ Security scan (npm audit)
- ✅ Preview release-metadata (Unreleased notes; no package version bump)

### Main Branch (`main`)

**Strict Requirements**:
- ✅ All CI checks must pass
- ✅ Preview deployment must be successful
- ✅ At least 1 maintainer review
- ✅ No force pushes or deletions

**Email**: [phantan7211@gmail.com](mailto:phantan7211@gmail.com)

Please include:
- Your organization name
- Description of the issue
- Any error messages or screenshots
- Urgency level (critical, high, normal, low)

### For General Bugs/Features

Please use GitHub Issues for:
- Bug reports
- Feature requests
- General questions about the codebase

This helps maintain a public record and benefits the entire community.

## Coding Guidelines

EquipQR follows strict coding standards to maintain quality and consistency.

### Language & Style

- **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for all new code
- **Strict Mode**: Enable strict type checking
- **No `any`**: Avoid `any` type; use proper types or `unknown`
- **ESLint**: Follow the project's ESLint configuration
- **Formatting**: Code is auto-formatted (handled by tooling)

### Architecture Patterns

Follow the patterns documented in [`docs/architecture/`](./docs/architecture/):

1. **Component Hierarchy**:
   - Pages: `src/pages/` (route-level, <300 LOC)
   - Features: `src/components/[feature]/` (e.g., `equipment/`, `work-orders/`)
   - UI Primitives: `src/components/ui/` (shadcn-style, no business logic)

2. **Data Patterns**:
   - Custom Hooks: `src/hooks/` for data fetching (TanStack Query)
   - Services: `src/services/` for business logic (stateless)
   - Contexts: `src/contexts/` for global state (Auth, Organization, Settings)

3. **File Naming**:
   - Components: PascalCase (e.g., `EquipmentList.tsx`)
   - Files/folders: kebab-case (e.g., `equipment-list.tsx`)
   - Hooks: `use` prefix (e.g., `useEquipment.ts`)

### Multi-Tenancy

**Critical**: Every database query must filter by `organization_id`:

```typescript
// ✅ Correct
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('equipment')
  .select('*')
  .eq('organization_id', orgId);

// ❌ Wrong - security vulnerability!
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('equipment')
  .select('*');
```

### Testing

EquipQR follows a **journey-first** testing strategy. See [`docs/technical/testing-guidelines.md`](./docs/technical/testing-guidelines.md) for complete details.

**Key principles**:
- **Default to journey tests**: Render real pages, use `userEvent`, assert on visible outcomes
- **Mock at boundaries**: Mock Supabase client, not internal hooks
- **Unit tests are selective**: Use for pure utilities and complex business rules only
- Aim for >70% code coverage

```bash
# Run tests
npm run test

# Unit or component project only
npm run test:unit
npm run test:component

# With coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

**Journey test template** (for new features):

```typescript
import { describe, it, expect, beforeEach } from 'vitest';
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event';
import { screen, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import { renderJourney } from '@vitest-harness/journey/render-journey';
import { seedSupabaseMock, resetSupabaseMock } from '@vitest-harness/mocks/supabase-scenario';

describe('Feature Journey', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    resetSupabaseMock();
    seedSupabaseMock({ /* fixture data */ });
  });

  it('allows user to perform action', async () => {
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    renderJourney({ persona: 'admin', route: '/dashboard/feature' });

    await user.click(await screen.findByRole('button', { name: /action/i }));

    expect(await screen.findByText(/success/i)).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```

### Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Update relevant docs in `docs/` for major changes
- Include inline comments for complex logic
- Reference architecture docs when applicable

## Change Management Policy

**CRITICAL**: All code changes to EquipQR must follow this Change Management Policy to ensure security, quality, and compliance.

### Requirements

1. **All Changes Require Pull Requests**
   - No direct commits to `main` (except emergency hotfixes with post-merge review)
   - All changes must go through a Pull Request (PR) workflow
   - PRs must be created from feature branches (`feat/`, `fix/`, etc.)

2. **Pull Request Approval Required**
   - At least **one maintainer approval** is required before merging
   - PRs cannot be merged by the author without approval
   - Maintainers must review code for:
     - Security implications (RLS policies, authentication, authorization)
     - Code quality and adherence to standards
     - Test coverage
     - Documentation updates

3. **CI/CD Checks Must Pass**
   - All CI checks must pass before merge:
     - Linting (ESLint)
     - Type checking (TypeScript)
     - Unit tests with coverage thresholds
     - Build validation
     - Security scans (npm audit)

4. **Database Changes**
   - All database migrations must be reviewed for:
     - RLS policy correctness
     - Performance implications
     - Data migration safety
   - Migrations must be idempotent and reversible (where possible)

5. **Security Review**
   - Changes affecting authentication, authorization, or data access require security review
   - RLS policy changes must be verified for tenant isolation
   - New API endpoints must have proper authentication and authorization

6. **Documentation**
   - Code changes that affect user-facing features require documentation updates
   - API changes require API documentation updates
   - Breaking changes require migration guides

### Emergency Hotfixes

In rare cases, emergency hotfixes may bypass normal PR approval:
- Only for critical production issues (security vulnerabilities, data loss, service outages)
- Must be followed by immediate post-merge review
- Must include explanation of why normal process was bypassed
- Must be documented in the PR description

### Enforcement

- GitHub branch protection rules enforce these policies
- Automated CI/CD pipelines block merges that don't meet requirements
- Manual review by maintainers ensures compliance

## Pull Request Guidelines

### Before Submitting

- [ ] Code follows the style guidelines
- [ ] Tests pass (`npm run test`)
- [ ] Linting passes (`npm run lint`)
- [ ] Type checking passes (`npm run type-check`)
- [ ] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Documentation updated if needed

### PR Structure

**Title**: Use conventional commit format
- `feat: add equipment photo upload`
- `fix: resolve work order assignment bug`
- `docs: update API reference`
- `refactor: simplify auth context`
- `chore: refresh dependency lockfile`

**Description**: Include
- Summary of changes
- Related issue(s): `Fixes #123`, `Relates to #456`
- Testing performed
- Screenshots for UI changes
- Breaking changes (if any)
- Migration steps (if any)

### Size Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused and small (<500 lines changed)
- Break large features into multiple PRs
- Separate refactoring from feature changes
- One concern per PR

### Review Process

1. Create PR from a feature branch to `preview`
2. CI checks run automatically
3. Address any failing checks
4. Request review from maintainers
5. Make requested changes
6. Maintainer approves and merges to `preview` (`preview.equipqr.app` updates)
7. Promote via `preview` → `main` / `/release` when shipping; **Production Release Readiness** runs migrations, schema drift, and **`vercel promote`**
8. Version tags are created automatically when `package.json` changes on `main`

### Merge Strategy

- **Squash and merge** for feature PRs (clean history)
